# BLDC_speedcontol_project
Introduction:

The brushless DC (BLDC) motor is a 3-phase motor which we do with sensor. BLDC 
(Brushless DC) motor speed control with rpm display system is a system, that offers the BLDC 
motor to run at different speeds and display this speed on LCD display. The importance of 
BLDC motor is increasing day by day because it has been mostly used in industries for different 
applications such as spinning, drilling and elevators. Similarly, its speed control is also too 
much important. Different companies are making their motor drive circuits with different types 
of controllers. But their cost is so much high and its operating system is quite difficult. Here 
we are offering a system that is called a BLDC motor speed control with RPM display system 
with the help of Aurdino and ESC.LCD display bridge rectifier , voltage regulator and IR 
sensors.
In this system, the speed of BLDC motor is controlled by changing the duty ratio of supplying 
voltages. This system is less costly, quite simple and control the speed of BLDC motor more 
precisely with displaying of on LCD display. So here we use Aurdino and ESC to control the 
speed of BLDC motor with the help of potentiometer.
Since these motors have the ability to work with the available low voltage sources such as 12v 
DC supply. It makes the brushless DC motors fans convenient for use in electronic equipment 
computers, mobile equipment, vehicles and spindle drives for disk memory, because of its high 
reliability, efficiency and ability to reverse rapidly. The speed control ofthe BLDC motors is 
archived by varying the duty cycles (PWM Pulses) from the keypad and delivers the desired 
output to switch the motor driver so as to control the speed of the BLDC motor. The 
speedsensed by the ‘IR’ sensor is given to the microcontroller to display it on the (LCD) display

Objective:
The objective of our project is to control the speed of a brushless DC (BLDC) motor with the 
help of a microcontroller. We will be using Arduino in our project for the speed control and 
RPM monitor that offers the BLDC motor to run at different speeds and displays this speed on 
LCD display.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY:

• In this project Controlling the motor can be done accurately. 
• It displays its speed using IR method of speed sensor mechanism. 
• This system provides an efficient mechanism for increasing or decreasing the speed.
• To control the rotation, adjust the magnitude and direction of the current into the coils 
in the BLDC motor
