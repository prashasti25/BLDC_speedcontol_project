BLDC (Brushless DC) motor speed control with rpm display system is a system, that offers the BLDC 
motor to run at different speeds and display this speed on LCD display. 
The proposed system that is called a BLDC motor speed control with RPM display system is a cost efficient system.
The system designed with the help of Aurdino and ESC, LCD display bridge rectifier, voltage regulator and IR 
sensors.
